- Added settings to play adhan only on certain days (like play Dhuhr on Sundays and not the other days)
- Fixed reminders (they should work more reliably now)
- Allow reminders to play adhan
- Added option to show/play reminder only once
- There's a change to settings internally, no problem should occur during the update, but if you decided to use an older version after updating, you will lose your reminders.
- App will now always open fullscreen alarm when Adhan is playing when you open the App
